---

## Phase 14 — Infrastructure & Self-Hosting 🔄

> Full tool options (Docker vs cloud) for embeddings, vector stores, and observability: see [AI_DATA_STRATEGY.md](./AI_DATA_STRATEGY.md).

**Automation (existing):**
- [x] Docker Compose — GroupScout + n8n + Redis
- [x] n8n workflow — trigger `/run` and `/digest` on schedule
- [x] `/n8n/webhook` endpoint — receive external leads from n8n

**Monitoring (existing):**
- [x] Prometheus + Grafana Loki — infrastructure monitoring + log aggregation

**Analytics:**
- [ ] Metabase or Grafana — connect to `groupscout.db` for lead analytics dashboard

**LLM Observability:**
- [ ] Langfuse — track Claude API calls, token costs, prompt versions, hallucinations
  - Cloud: free hobby tier (start here)
  - Docker: `langfuse/langfuse` + Postgres backend (add at Phase 6)

**Embeddings (for RAG):**
- [ ] Ollama (`ollama/ollama`) — local embedding server (`nomic-embed-text`); free, no external API
  - Cloud alternative: Voyage AI `voyage-3-lite` (free 200M tokens/month, best Claude pairing)

**Vector Store (for RAG):**
- [ ] Qdrant (`qdrant/qdrant`) — REST API, Go client, lightweight; replaces in-memory cosine at scale
  - Postgres path: pgvector extension instead (no extra container; preferred if on Phase 6 Postgres)

**Search:**
- [ ] Meilisearch — fast full-text lead search for Admin UI

**Notifications:**
- [ ] Gotify or Apprise — alternative/secondary notification channels

**Error Tracking:**
- [ ] Sentry self-hosted (Docker) — if data privacy becomes a concern

---


---

## Phase 15 — PostgreSQL + pgvector Migration ✅

> **Why now:** repository pattern already in place; Docker already running; data is tiny; pgvector unlocks RAG.
> **Replaces** the Postgres portion of Phase 6.
> Full atomic tasks: see `PHASES.md` Phase 15.

**Part A — Postgres container + driver:**
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — add `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` + named volume + health check
- [x] `go.mod` — add `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` (pure Go, no CGO); keep SQLite for local dev fallback
- [x] `config/config.go` — `DriverName()` helper; selects driver from `DATABASE_URL` prefix
- [x] `internal/storage/db.go` — `Open()` routes to pgx or SQLite based on driver
- [x] Verify: connects to Postgres; no migrations yet

**Part B — Schema (Postgres-compatible migrations):**
- [x] `migrations/001_init.postgres.up.sql` — native types: `UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`, `BOOLEAN`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `JSONB`
- [x] `internal/storage/db.go` — wire `golang-migrate/migrate` for both drivers
- [x] Verify: migrations run clean; tests pass

**Part C — Storage layer fixes:**
- [x] `internal/storage/leads.go` — remove `boolToInt()`; `?` → `$N` placeholders; native `bool` + `time.Time`
- [x] `internal/storage/raw.go` — `?` → `$N`; `raw_data` writes as JSONB
- [x] Verify: full pipeline end-to-end against Postgres

**Part D — pgvector:**
- [x] `migrations/003_pgvector.up.sql` — `CREATE EXTENSION vector`; `lead_embeddings` with `vector(512)` + ivfflat index
- [x] `internal/storage/embeddings.go` — `PostgresEmbeddingStore` using `<=>` cosine distance
- [x] `internal/enrichment/embeddings.go` — factory: `postgres://` → pgvector; `*.db` → Go cosine
- [x] Verify: similarity search uses index (`EXPLAIN`)

**Part E — Data migration + productionize:**
- [x] `scripts/migrate_to_postgres/main.go` — copy SQLite rows to Postgres in batches
- [x] `.env.example` — update `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres format
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — app `depends_on` Postgres health check
- [x] `docs/SETUP.md` — update setup instructions
- [x] Verify: `docker compose up` → migrations → full pipeline on Postgres

---

## Phase 16 — LLM Provider Abstraction 🔭

> Remove vendor lock-in from `internal/enrichment`. All LLM calls go through a `LLMClient` interface. Provider is config-driven — switch between Claude, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, or Gemini without touching pipeline code.

- [ ] **Part A** — Interface Extraction: refactor `ClaudeEnricher` to `ClaudeClient` implementing `LLMClient`.
- [ ] **Part B** — OpenAI-Compatible Client: covers OpenAI, Groq, and Mistral.
- [ ] **Part C** — Azure OpenAI Support.
- [ ] **Part D** — Ollama Support: local / Docker, free and private.
- [ ] **Part E** — Fallback & Resilience: primary → secondary on error.

---

## Phase 17 — Airport Disruption Alert System (`alertd`) ✅

**Goal:** A separate real-time binary (`cmd/alertd/`) that monitors YVR flight disruptions and alerts the hotel team via Slack.

### Part A — Data Acquisition & Weather
- [x] ECCC Weather Poller (`internal/weather/eccc.go`)
- [x] YVR Flight Status Scraper (`internal/aviation/yvr.go`)
- [x] NavCanada NOTAM Parser (`internal/aviation/navcanada.go`)

### Part B — Stranded Passenger Score (SPS)
- [x] SPS formula + Vancouver tuning (`internal/aviation/scorer.go`)

### Part C — Alert Lifecycle State Machine
- [x] State machine: Watch → Alert → Update → Resolve (`internal/alert/lifecycle.go`)
- [x] Slack notification with Block Kit (`internal/alert/slack.go`)

### Part D — Hotel Config & Binary
- [x] Hotel ↔ airport config loader (`config/airports.go`)
- [x] Main poll loop (`cmd/alertd/main.go`)

### Part E — Inventory Slash Command

---

## Phase 19 — Slack Actions & Lead Feedback 📋

---


---

## Phase 20 — Housekeeping & Developer Experience ✅

**Goal:** Improve local development workflow and project documentation.

- [x] **20.1** `Makefile` — Central hub for build, test, lint, and Docker tasks.
- [x] **20.2** `scripts/test-ollama.sh` — Automated verification of local Ollama setup.
- [x] **20.3** `docs/guides/TESTING.md` — Comprehensive testing guide.
- [x] **20.4** `DEVELOPER.md` — Refactored Makefile-driven workflow.
- [x] **20.5** `.env.example` — Verified essential variables.

---

## Phase 21 — Ollama Prod Hardening ✅

**Goal:** Secure and observe the local LLM infrastructure in production.

- [x] **21.1** `docker-compose.yml` — Added `promtail` for log aggregation.
- [x] **21.2** `config/promtail.yaml` — Configured container log scraping for Loki.
- [x] **21.3** `scripts/backup-volumes.sh` — Automated backup script for all Docker volumes.
- [x] **21.4** `docs/guides/DOCKER.md` — Model management, backup, and monitoring instructions.

---

## Phase 22 — Multi-Property Support 📋

> Configure and run GroupScout for multiple hotel properties with different geographies, segments, and thresholds. No changes to the collector/enrichment core — all config-driven. See `PHASES.md` Phase 22 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — Property Config Model: name, location (lat/lng), segments, Slack webhook.
- [ ] **Part B** — Property-Scoped Pipeline: geo-match raw projects against property radius.
- [ ] **Part C** — Alertd Multi-Hotel Config: unify airport alertd and lead property config.

---

## Phase 23 — Advanced Intelligence: Repeat Detection & Signal Quality 📋

> Detect organizations that have brought groups to the market before. Surface signal quality metrics that help the team focus on leads most likely to convert. See `PHASES.md` Phase 23 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — Repeat Pattern Detection: fuzzy-match incoming GCs against historical outreach log wins.
- [ ] **Part B** — Signal Quality Metrics: rate each source by conversion rate (claimed leads / total leads).

---

## Phase 24 — Agentic Reasoning & Tool-Calling 📋

> Upgrade enrichment from single-call LLM to multi-step reasoning for borderline permits (score 5–7, value > $2M). Claude tool-use for BC Registry lookup + LinkedIn URL generation. See `PHASES.md` Phase 24 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — ReAct loop: second LLM call with tool results injected; activated by `REACT_ENABLED=true`
- [ ] **Part B** — Tool implementations: `internal/tools/bc_registry.go` (OrgBook API, no key) + `internal/tools/linkedin.go` (URL builder, no API)
- [ ] **Part C** — Multimodal PDF enrichment via Claude vision (deferred until 5+ cities)

---

## Phase 25 — AI Observability & Quality 📋

> Track LLM call quality, token costs, and prompt versions. Add AI-Ready SQL view to simplify prompt construction. Structural eval harness to catch bad enrichment outputs before they hit Slack. See `PHASES.md` Phase 25 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — AI-Ready SQL: `v_lead_context` view + `GetContext()` method; refactor prompt builders
- [ ] **Part B** — Langfuse integration: trace per LLM call (model, tokens, latency, score); noop client when key absent
- [ ] **Part C** — Enrichment eval: `EvalLead()` structural validation + Sentry on hard failures

---

## Phase 26 — Production Deployment & Event-Driven Ingestion 📋

> Deploy the full stack to production. **Hetzner CX32 + Coolify (~$10/month) is the primary recommendation** — it runs both binaries as persistent containers, deploys your existing `docker-compose.yml` directly, and includes n8n/Prometheus/Loki at no extra cost. Railway is the managed-PaaS alternative (~$10–18/month). GCP Cloud Run is **incompatible with `alertd`** (scales to zero; daemon needs persistent compute). See `docs/planning/DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md` for the full analysis.
>
> See `PHASES.md` Phase 26 for atomic tasks.

- [ ] **Part A** — Home server: No-IP/DuckDNS DDNS + port forwarding → Traefik + Let's Encrypt → optional Cloudflare Tunnel; `docs/guides/HOME_DEPLOY.md`
- [ ] **Part B** — Hetzner + Coolify cloud deploy (if uptime SLA matters): VPS provision, Coolify setup, backup config, `docs/guides/COOLIFY.md`
- [ ] **Part C** — Event-driven ingestion: `POST /ingest` + `EnrichOne()` (platform-agnostic)
- [ ] **Part D** — Terraform IaC for GCP (optional; alertd needs Compute Engine VM — Cloud Run won't work)

---

## Phase 27 — Input Audit & Verification Trail ✅

**Goal:** Implement a system to store and track all raw inputs (PDFs, API responses, etc.) to allow for verification of the lead enrichment and scoring process.

- [x] **Part A** — Storage Architecture: `raw_inputs` table + `AuditStore` interface
- [x] **Part B** — Collector Integration: save raw PDF/API content before parsing
- [x] **Part C** — Verification Tools: `GET /leads/{id}/raw` + CLI audit tool
- [x] **Part D** — Retention & Privacy: Purge old records, PII redaction

---

## Phase 28 — Analytics & Source Attribution 📋

**Goal:** Weekly digest that shows which signal sources are generating closed business, enabling the sales team to prioritize outreach.

- [ ] **Part A** — Source Attribution: Aggregate leads by source + outcome
- [ ] **Part B** — Slack Analytics: Hit Rate % columns in digest
- [ ] **Part C** — Market Demand: Forward demand density view

---

## Phase 29 — Prompt Engineering & Strict TDD 📋

**Goal:** Transition prompts into a formal library with evaluation metrics and strict Test-Driven Development.

- [ ] **Part A — Infrastructure:** Extract hardcoded strings to `assets/prompts/*.tmpl`; implement template loader in `internal/enrichment`.
- [ ] **Part B — Strict TDD:** Create `internal/enrichment/prompts_test.go` with gold standard fixtures.
- [ ] **Part C — Refinement:** Add "Few-Shot" examples for high-priority/complex lead types.

---

## Phase 30 — Advanced Audit & Verification 📋

**Goal:** Transform the raw audit trail into a proactive verification and quality assurance system.

- [ ] **Part A — Verification Workflow:** `POST /leads/{id}/verify` + corrections (JSONB)
- [ ] **Part B — AI Verification Agent:** `Verifier` struct + verification prompt
- [ ] **Part C — Health & Analytics:** Extraction accuracy aggregator + drift detection
